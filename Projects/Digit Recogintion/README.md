# Part 1

### working on the MNIST dataset to do the following :

1 - Implementation of Linear Regression with Closed Form Solution

2 - SVM with Scikit-Learn

3 - Multinomial (Softmax) Regression and Gradient Descent and exploring the effect of the Temperature term

4 - Dimensionality Reduction via PCA

5 - Kernel methods ( Polynomial Kernel - radial basis function )


## The Files Description :

#### - part1/linear_regression.py where the implementation of linear regression

#### - part1/svm.py where the implementation of support vector machine

#### - part1/softmax.py where the implementation of multinomial regression

#### - part1/features.py where the implementation oft principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction

#### - part1/kernel.py where the implementation of polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels

#### - part1/main.py where you can use the code wrote for this part of the project
