# Part 1

### working on the MNIST dataset to do the following :

1 - Implementation of Linear Regression with Closed Form Solution

2 - SVM with Scikit-Learn

3 - Multinomial (Softmax) Regression and Gradient Descent and exploring the effect of the Temperature term

4 - Dimensionality Reduction via PCA

5 - Kernel methods ( Polynomial Kernel - radial basis function )


## The Files Description :

#### - part1/linear_regression.py where the implementation of linear regression

#### - part1/svm.py where the implementation of support vector machine

#### - part1/softmax.py where the implementation of multinomial regression

#### - part1/features.py where the implementation oft principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction

#### - part1/kernel.py where the implementation of polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels

#### - part1/main.py where you can use the code wrote for this part of the project


# Part 2

### working on the MNIST dataset to do the following :

1 - Implement a simple neural net with an architecture as shown in the figure below

2 - Use deep neural networks to perform the classification task using PyTorch 

3 - Apply convolutional neural networks to the same task

4 - train a new neural networks to solve the problem of hand-written digit recognition using a multi-digit version of MNIST

## The Files Description :

#### part2-nn/neural_nets.py in which you'll implement your first neural net from scratch

#### part2-mnist/nnet_fc.py where you'll start using PyTorch to classify MNIST digits

#### part2-mnist/nnet_conv.py where you will use convolutional layers to boost performance

#### part2-twodigit/mlp.py and part2-twodigit/conv.py which are for a new, more difficult version of the MNIST dataset
