Your overall score in this class will be a weighted average of your scores for the different components, with the following weights:

16% for the lecture exercises (divided equally among the 16 out of 19 lectures)
18% for the homeworks (divided equally among 6 (out of 7) homeworks)
2% for the Project 0
36% for the Projects (divided equally among 4 (out of 5)
12% for the Midterm exam (timed)
16% for the final exam (timed)

To earn a verified certificate for this course, you will need to obtain an overall score of 60% or more of the maximum possible overall score.

Lecture Exercises, Problem Sets, and Projects

    The lowest 3 scores among the 19 lectures will be dropped, so only 16 out of 19 lectures will count .

    The lowest 1 scores among the 7 homeworks will be dropped, so only 6 out of 7 homeworks will count .

    The lowest 1 score among the 5 projects (excluding project 0) will be dropped, so only 4 out of 5 projects will count .
